## Overview 

For voracious readers, the internet can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many sites out there, with so much great content, so many links to click, so many recommendations to follow. It's easy to end up with a seemingly endless collection of open browser tabs, and no time to sit at your computer to read them all. 

Enter ReadMe: an offline-first mobile app that—together with its [companion browser extension](https://github.com/Project-Readme/ReadMe-browser-extension "extension repository")—allows a reader to save articles, blog posts, and other text from their desktops and retrieve that content later for reading on their mobile device. If a user does run out of things to read our app has recommendations for them on the home screen. 

## Getting Started

This app is available on the [Expo](https://expo.io/ "Expo homepage") platform. After you have installed Expo onto your device you can run the app via this link (the easier option,) or by building your own copy.  

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it with the [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm "npm cli documentation") by running `npm install`. 

With Expo installed, you can then run `npm start` to launch the app. 

To log in to our app you can create an account, or use the following credentials:
> username: guest<br />
> password: password

**Deleting/Searching and Offline**

Articles are downloaded from the remote database and saved locally on a user's device for offline reading. A user can also search for specific articles in their list by typing the name of the article in the search bar.
